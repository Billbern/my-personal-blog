It would appear the number of outdoor activities may be reduced. Freezing temperatures in the north and mountain areas leave you wondering what to engage in as a family. I’ve come up with some solutions when the weather is not at its best for outdoor activities.", 
            "tags": ["family"], "content": "Below is a list of indoor winter activities that your entire family can enjoy. These activities can help kick boredom of staying indoors and even create an opportunity for family bonding time, which would be my favorite reason. Why Not Check Out the Local Museums What better time to visit a museum that your family will surely enjoy.  Now, some museums have free entrance, and some do get a little pricey, but it’s a great time for your family and a great learning experience. Depending on where you live, here’s a list of the types of museums you could explore together:  History, Maritime,  Military and War museums, Art, Sports, Living History, Science, Children’s museums, Natural History, Archaeology museums to name a few.   Something for everybody! You may not have all of these types of museums in your area, but I think every large city will have a few to enjoy.  If there are museums near you, winter can sometimes be the best time to explore what they have to offer; therefore, you and your family can learn about whatever it is that interests you collectively. Attend Concerts, Sports, Show/Theatre, Comedy Shows Attending a concert is so much fun and entertaining. To check out any upcoming concerts in your area, a  fantastic place to find out what is going on in your area is at  tickets-center.com.  You can search by your state or  city, and they will list all the events in your area. It’s fantastic! Depending on the nature of the concert, some are free and others you pay for.  There are concerts out there to suit everyone in your family. Don’t forget about orchestras. Are you interested in comedy shows?  Check out showclix.com for shows in your area. How about local tours? I know friends who love to check out the local tours, which could be a scenic experience, by boat, by charter bus, local brewery and winery tours. I do love to be at home, but there are plenty of people always looking for something to do, and this is a surefire way to enjoy your weekend. Historical Home Tours I’ll bet you can find more historic home tours in your area than you even knew existed.  They are usually a guided tour throughout the home and property, and I think it’s just really interesting to hear the history behind the home.  It’s also a neat way to spend a couple of hours. Playing Cards and Board Games Indoor games have been a source of entertainment for decades. These fun indoor games are great for wintertime when perhaps you’ll spend less time outdoors, depending on the weather situation. The next time you are feeling bored, you can get creative and ask your family members to participate in board or card games. Learn some together.  Some younger children may like Uno or SkipBo to start.  These are fun activities that will keep you focused all winter long. I’ve got a site where you can learn how to play just about any card game at https://www.pagat.com/. Indoor Laser Tag Indoor Laser Tag can be a “blast” for a day with friends or family.  If you go to https://www.yelp.com/nearme/laser-tag, they will assist in finding a place nearby to play.  They also sell laser tag sets that come with lasers and vests.

This game has grown to be quite common over the years; therefore, finding an ideal laser tag arena near you shouldn’t be a problem. Paintball You can play paintball indoors and outdoors. It’s okay to play in your yard, provided you’re not disturbing your neighbors.  Generally, it’s $10 to $25 per person to play.  Purchasing paintballs on-site can run anywhere from $35 to $60 for a count of 2000 paintballs.  Now, straight from Oxford Dictionaries, here’s the definition of the game:  “a game in which participants simulate military combat using air guns to shoot capsules of paint at each other.”  It can be very competitive, but wildly fun! Challenge Yourselves in an Escape Room I had never even heard of these escape rooms until one day on an outing out of state, we stopped for some food, and next door was an interesting looking place.  We asked about it, and the person behind the counter of the restaurant told us what an escape room is. Does your family have the skills and teamwork to get yourselves out of an escape room in 60 minutes?  The escape room is a game that can break the winter monotony for your family. Escape room games will give your family a mind-blowing experience and creates the perfect bonding opportunity.

Thanks to streaming services, nowadays, families may not have the opportunity to bond over watching a movie together like we used to.  Kids have their thing going, and so do you.  You can change that this winter by going to the movies and having dinner afterward so that you can share the best scenes from the film together while sharing a meal.  My very favorite outing is to go to our dinner theatre near me.  I can see comedies, concerts, musicals, all while sharing a meal. It’s my favorite!!

What exactly is a “rainbow baby”? Let’s read more about it and why do we call it as a rainbow baby. The symbolism of a rainbow A rainbow baby is a name coined for a healthy baby born after losing a baby due to miscarriage, infant loss, stillbirth, or neonatal death. The name “rainbow baby” comes from the idea of a rainbow appearing in the sky after a storm, or after a dark and turbulent time. The term has gained popularity on blogs and social media in recent years, and has come to symbolize hope and healing. For those who have experienced the loss of a baby, the birth of a rainbow baby is a time of immense joy, reflection, healing, and mixed emotions.  Rainbow babies are often described as ‘miracle’ babies due to the powerful impact they can have on helping parents heal after a loss. However, rainbow pregnancies can bring strong feelings of anxiety, guilt, and even fear. Conflicting emotions of honoring a baby who has died while celebrating one that’s healthy — and grieving a loss while celebrating new life — often accompany a rainbow birth.  The exact number of rainbow babies born every year isn’t known, largely because miscarriages are often under or unreported If you’re expecting a rainbow baby, here are some of the things you may experience. That same spirit has encouraged me to enjoy my current pregnancy more than before. Morning sickness and heartburn can't take away my gratitude for the chance to carry a healthy baby. Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, M.D., MSc, Obstetrics and Gynecology, CareMount Medical says this is normal. 'For parents who have experienced the loss of a child, whether that loss occurs before or after birth, the life adjustments associated with pregnancy are accompanied with an acute sense of gratitude even when they are uncomfortable,' she tells us. 'And although most of us have the great fortune of being wanted babies, parents tend to have a special, and in many cases incredibly sharp, sense of being blessed when they are expecting and then giving birth to a baby that follows loss.' But Dr. Kulp-Makarov cautionsComputer Technology Articles, 'The birth and newborn stage of a rainbow baby are different for parents who have suffered a loss. They can expect a rush of strong and complicated emotions. Parents may swing between this amazing awe at their new baby and strong fear that something may happen and they may lose this new baby too.'"

However, change management is basically a combination of both working simultaneously as a change in the people will be led to change in the organization. When organizations undertake potential projects or initiate efforts to improve employees’ performance etc. they undergo change. Changes can be of different nature like change in processes, job descriptions/designations, organizational structures etc. The term change management can be referring to a discipline that how a change leadership can prepare and support its employees working on all levels of the organization to adapt to the change in order to attain organizational success and achieve desired goals.                          Leadership skills                         leadership is important in a time of crisis and problems as it does not focus on improving future but emphasize on rectifying faults and mistakes of the present.

          "img": "/static/img/default-img.png", "summary": "There are millions of children around the world who live in poverty and are unable to educate themselves. It's not because they don't want to go to school or learn new things to become successful - they do. They are passionate to sit in the classroom, make new friends, study and lead a successful life. So, why aren’t they living the life the way they desire? Because they’re underprivileged.", 
          "tags": ["Education"], "content": "In this article, we have compiled a list of top 8 challenges faced by the students living in rural areas.      8 Barriers Students Living in Poor Areas Face         1.Lack of Educational Funding We mostly observe developing countries facing financial issues when it comes to funding schools or colleges. They neither have enough sponsors nor do they get it from the world. Turn out, this becomes one of the most challenging parts where the administrators have no choice but to decrease the quality of the education. It becomes necessary to do so because of lack of funds and these underprivileged students suffer.                            2.Untrained or No Teachers                         Students can learn only when their teachers are capable enough to deliver the lectures. Sadly, most of the schools in poor areas do not have instructors with enough qualifications and skills. They are only focused on making money, neglecting the future of those kids and the country. In this case, the students either drop out or skip school because they aren't getting what they have paid for.                                         3.No Decent Classroom or Space                How can you expect a child to show interest in the studies when they don't have a proper learning environment? Many children around the world study in a crowded classroom or classrooms that have no desks and chairs. They also have insufficient learning and qualification supplies to provide the students, let alone a small room to sit and study.               4.Children with Disabilities Generally speaking, a disabled person is often neglected and mistreated just because they are differently-abled or special. When it comes to education, they are not even given equal rights and often get expelled due to multiple issues. It is high time that we realise that education is everyone's right and this discrimination hurts their morale and self-confidence.                               5.Lack of Learning Material                          No matter how efficiently a teacher delivers a lecture, there is a need for learning materials. It helps the students understand the topic deeply, improve student focus and help them in raising questions in case of confusions. However, in most of the low-financed schools, there is no custom of providing the learners with notes, chapters or textbooks. This is why, the learners end up losing grades or performing poorly in overall academic performance.                  6. Gender Discrimination                In many areas around the world, male students are considered privileged. This is why, education is only permitted to them. On the other hand, females are forced to look after the household chores. Roughly around 100 million female children are denied admission just because they are the inappropriate gender for education. This has become a global debate where several influencers are fighting for women and female rights especially for basic education.                                    7. Commute Problems                          Since there are very few schools around the locality, students in poor areas travel at least 10 KM back and forth from their home to school. Some of them are foot travellers while others travellers use vehicles or carts. Either way, each one of them struggle physically and on monetary terms to get high-quality education. At times, when it becomes dreadful for them, they drop the idea of going to school completely.                     8.Education Expenses                     People living in rural areas are already low on budget and spending a few pennies on education which makes it difficult for them to meet ends. So, they deny their children the basic right and force them to earn money instead. The children themselves have no say in this and are obliged to do what they are ordered.                                        What Teachers Can Do?                       Being a teacher you can do the following things for your students to make education easy for them.                        1.Conduct Private Extra Classes            Most of the time the class timings are not enough for the students to concentrate and learn new things. You can offer them some extra classes after school to help them understand each topic clearly.       2.Build a Bond                            Students are often shy and remain quiet throughout the lectures. This may keep you wondering whether or not they grasp what you are saying. In this way, you can offer them support and ask questions during the class to ensure they understand. It will help you know them better and develop a much stronger bond.            3.Visualise Your Lectures                   Plain and boring lessons often decreases students' interest in the subject. You can enhance engagement by adding pictures, graphs or other types of visuals in your lectures.                           4.Help Prioritise the Assignments                                         Younger students living in poverty often have a chaotic life. They have responsibilities at home to fulfil and tons of assignments may get neglected in between. Here, you can help them schedule their assignments priority wise to prevent them from missing out on the deadlines.                                        5.Step Up to Bullies                          Not only in poor areas but in well-developed localities too, there are cases where students bully each other. It becomes so toxic that the victim tries to stay at home and avoid school altogether. Being a teacher, if you sense bully among the students, you must confront the tormentor.                                      Moving Towards a Vibrant Learning Environment                                       These are the few ways teachers can ensure that the students get top quality education regardless of the class they belong to. After all, classrooms are the only place where they learn about various aspects and explore themselves.

          "tags": ["Education", "Tech"], "content": "Data science trends in 2020               Presently, data science is a common term. That was not the case at that time five years ago, because only a few people knew about it. Do you need to know what it is before moving on further? It is nothing else but a multidisciplinary combination of data inference, development of algorithms, and technology.                                                         Data Science is not a single term; it covers a wide range of subjects and networks, such as the Internet of Things, Deep Learning, AI, etc. Simply put, we can count data science as a total blend of data inference, computational algorithms, analysis, and technology that helps to solve multifaceted business problems. It also provides companies with advanced tools and technology that enable them to automate complicated business processes linked to the extraction, analysis, and presentation of raw data. With so much happening in the technical field and the data being produced at a rapid pace, it is crucial to know the latest trends in data science as well as the upcoming ones.                            Kaggle's CEO Anthony Goldbloom predicts that departmental or business-specific teams will be seen instead of data centers, while Babson College professor Thomas H. Davenport claims that artificial intelligence (AI) will see improvement in 2020. When people were asked about data trends in 2020, AI remained on top position. We have created a list of data science trends to keep you up-to-date with the developments in data science that are going to drive your business towards great success.                    Artificial intelligence and smart apps                        AI has become the mainstream technology for both small and large businesses and will blossom in the coming years. We are currently at the initial stage of using artificial intelligence but we will see more sophisticated AI implementations in all fields in 2020. The reason AI is growing rapidly is that it allows companies to enhance their overall business processes, and provides a better way to handle data from both clients and consumers. Although using AI will remain a challenge for many, as it is not that easy to explore the development of this technology. We should see more innovative Apps built with AI, Machine Learning, and other innovations in 2020 that can improve the way we operate. Another phenomenon that will take over the industry is automated machine learning, which with better data management will help transform data science. So, to conduct deep learning you might need specialized training.            Growth in the IoT                             The investment in IoT technology is expected to reach $1 trillion by the end of 2020, which will clearly explain the development of smart and connected devices. We used apps and devices even in 2019 which allow us to control our home appliances such as AC, TV, etc. Some of you may not be able to do this now, only via IoT. If you've ever come across smart devices such as Google Assistant or Microsoft Cortana that allow us to automate the regular things, then you'll get an idea that the Internet of Things is constantly attracting users' attention. It will thus enable businesses to invest in this technology, especially in the production of smartphones that use IoT the most.                      Evolution of Big data analytics                               They simply can not ignore the Big Data research when it comes to data science, which helps businesses gain a competitive edge over data and achieve their goals. Companies today use various tools and technologies to analyze big data, especially python. Organizations are also focused on determining the causes behind certain incidents currently taking place. And that is where predictive & business analytics are used; it helps businesses foresee what can happen in the future. For example, predictive analysis helps you recognize your customers ' preferences from their history of buying or browsing. Based on that, you can build cleverer approaches for attracting new customers and retain the current one.                                                 Edge computing is expected to increase                      Now sensors drive edge computing. But Edge computing will take over conventional cloud systems with IoT rising. Edge computing helps companies to store streaming data close to the data sources for real-time analysis. It also offers a great alternative to Big Data analytics, requiring high-end storage devices and a higher capacity of the network. As the number of data collection devices and sensors is increasing rapidly, businesses are adopting edge computing, as it can tackle bandwidth, latency and security issues. The integration of edge computing and cloud technology can provide a structured system helping to minimize the risks involved in data analysis and management.                            Demand for Data science Security Professionals             The implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning will lead to many new industrial positions. One position that will be highly demanding is that of professionals in data science security. Data scientists must have experience in data science as well as command over computer science, as both Artificial Intelligence and ML depend entirely on data, and to process this information efficiently. Although the business market already has access to many specialists in data management and computer science, there is still a need for more skilled data security practitioners who can safely process data to clients. For that, scientists in data security need to be well versed with the latest data science or big data analysis techniques. Of starters, python is among the most commonly used languages in data science and data analysis, so having a clear understanding of python concepts will help you tackle data science security issues.                                                  Last words                                      Data Science has become one of the rising sectors of all industries, especially the IT industry. Therefore, businesses that implement data science methods and innovations need to keep up to date with the latest trends.

          "img": "/static/img/finance.png", "summary": "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return. The return on the investment is an unknown variable that has different values associated with different probabilities. and risk of investing in a security.", 
          "tags": ["finance"], "content": "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the link between regular risk and predictable return on assets, particularly inventory. CAPM is widely used throughout the financial sector to price risky securities and generate expected returns on assets, given the risk of these assets and the cost of capital.                      Formula                                 ERi = Rf+Βi (ERm−Rf)                      where:                                      ERi =expected return of investment        R f=risk-free rate                        β i=beta of the investment                (ERm −Rf)=market risk premium                   Arbitration Price Theory                                APT serves as an alternative to CAPM, and uses fewer assumptions and may be more difficult to implement than CAPM. Ross developed the APT based on the fact that bond prices are driven by several factors, which can be grouped into macroeconomic or company-specific factors.2 Unlike the CAPM, the APT does not indicate the identity or even the number of factors risk. Instead, for any multifactor model that is assumed to generate returns, which follows a return generation process, the theory provides the expression associated with the expected return on the asset. Although the CAPM formula requires the expected return of the market to enter, the APT formula uses the expected rate of return on an asset and the risk premium for various macroeconomic factors.                                                    At first glance, the CAPM and APT formulas look very much identical , but the CAPM has one factor and one beta. On the other hand, the APT formula has several factors that include non-company factors, which requires the beta of the asset in relation to each separate factor. However, the APT does not provide information on what those factors would be, therefore, users of the APT model must analytically determine relevant factors that may affect the return on the asset. On the other hand, the factor used in the CAPM is the difference between the market's expected rate of return and the risk-free rate of return.                                     Uses of CAPM Model                                        In different securities to contrast the rate of return, investors used CAPM. For example: investment funds, stocks, shares and bonds. A company can invest smartly in a portfolio, comparing wisely that it reduces risk and maximizes the rate of return.                 The other use of CAPM is to evaluate a portfolio or an investment. In a portfolio, assets can be bonds, real estate, warrants, options, stocks analysis, gold certificates or anything related that can support their value.                         CAPM is also used by modern portfolio theory (MPT) to choose suitable investments for a portfolio. It is a possible competitor for inclusion in the portfolio, if the investment is being sold for less than the calculated price.                     Discovering intrinsic value is a challenge for securities. Asset pricing is the quietest use of CAPM. Investors and analysts use it to evaluate adjacent to the book value and the market value of the shares. The asset is considered a good deal if it is traded below its intrinsic value.       For all projects, CAPM uses a discount rate and that is why it considers a quality superior to NPV. Therefore, to judge investment projects of all different types of risk, CAPM is often used    Assumptions of CAPM Model                            Investors are consistent and risk averse. They follow the curiosity to maximize the expected function of their wealth at the end of the period. Thus, if the risk is greater for a portfolio, the expected return will be greater.         The Marketplace is ideal, so short selling restrictions, transaction costs, inflation and taxes are not taken into account.                 The lender may lend or borrow unrestricted amounts at the risk-free rate.                              Each possession is substantially divisible and completely liquid.                            Investors have the same opinion on variation and the average as the only market valuation structure; therefore, each person perceives the same perspective. And all investors get the identical information at the identical time.    The return on the asset follows the rules of standard allocation.                            The markets are in symmetry, so the cost of security cannot be influenced by any entity.      The quantities and the total number of assets in the market are predetermined within the defined structure.                                      Benefits of CAPM Model                                 CAPM is a simple calculation that can be easily subjected to stress tests to derive a series of possible results to provide confidence around the required rates of return.                       The assumption that investors have a diversified portfolio, similar to the market portfolio, eliminates non-systematic (specific) risk.       Systematic or market risk is an important variable because it is unpredictable and, for this reason, it cannot often be completely mitigated.            When companies investigate opportunities, if the business mix and financing differ from current businesses, other necessary return calculations, such as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), cannot be used. So here CAPM can be used         Limitations of CAPM Model               The rate generally accepted as Rf is the yield on short-term government bonds. The problem with using this participation is that the give up changes daily, creating instability.                 A problem arises when, at any time, the market return can be negative. As a result, a long-term market return is used to smooth the return. Another issue is that these returns are retrospective and may not be representative of future market returns.                               CAPM is based on four main assumptions, including one that reflects an unreal image of the real world. This assumption - that investors can have a loan of and lend at a risk-free rate - is impossible in reality. Individual investors cannot borrow (or lend) at the same rate as the US government. Therefore, the required minimum return line may be less pronounced (provide a lower return) than the model calculates.                       Companies that use CAPM to evaluate an investment need to find a beta that reflects the project or investment. A beta proxy is often required. However, it is difficult to determine accurately to properly assess the project and can affect the reliability of the result.                                            CAPM uses the principles of modern portfolio theory to determine whether a security value is highly valued. It is based on assumptions about investor deeds, risk and revisit distributions and market essentials that do not correspond to realism. However, the original concepts of the CAPM and the connected efficient boundary can help investors understand the link between predictable risk and return, as they make better decisions about adding securities to a collection. In different securities to contrast the rate of return, investors used CAPM. For example: investment funds, stock advisorFind Article, shares and bonds.
